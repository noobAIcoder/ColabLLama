Free GPU options for LlaMA model experimentation

To those who are starting out on the llama model with llama.cpp or other similar models, you may feel tempted to purchase a used 3090, 4090, or an Apple M2 to run these models. However, I'd like to share that there are free alternatives available for you to experiment with before investing your hard-earned money.
Google Colab notebooks offer a decent virtual machine (VM) equipped with a GPU, and it's completely free to use.

Here are the typical specifications of this VM: 12 GB RAM 80 GB DISK Tesla T4 GPU with 15 GB VRAM

This setup is sufficient to run most models effectively. In the comments section, I will be sharing a sample Colab notebook specifically designed for beginners.
If you happen to know about any other free GPU VMs, please do share them in the comments below.
